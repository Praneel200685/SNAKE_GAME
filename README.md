# SNAKE_GAME
This project presents a classic Snake game developed using the Turtle graphics library and Python’s object-oriented programming features. The game offers intuitive controls through the keyboard’s arrow keys, allowing players to guide the snake around the GUI interface. With a clean design and responsive gameplay, this project efficiently manages game state, collision detection, and scoring. Built as a practical exercise while learning Python OOP concepts, it serves as an excellent demonstration of event handling, graphical programming, and encapsulation skills.
